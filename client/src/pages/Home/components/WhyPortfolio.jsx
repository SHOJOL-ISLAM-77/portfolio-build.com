          1. A portfolio helps you get your work noticed
        </h3>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-8 sm:mb-12 bg-secondary p-4 sm:p-6 rounded-md">
          Whether you’re a graphic designer, product designer, web developer, writer, illustrator, or are working within
          some other area of creativity, you need a way to get your work out there. A portfolio website gives your work
          visibility, putting it in front of the people you want to see it.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-8 sm:mb-12 bg-secondary p-4 sm:p-6 rounded-md">
          Unlike the static black and white of a traditional resume, an online portfolio brings your work to life. In
          full color, it makes engaging with your creative output an active and immediate experience.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl bg-secondary p-4 sm:p-6 rounded-md">
          Potential clients and employers get to see right away your accomplishments and what makes you unique. A
          personal portfolio shows them who you are as a creative professional, the thinking behind your work, and if
          you’re the right person for a particular job or project.

          2. A portfolio communicates who you are
        </h3>
        <div>

            Most of us wouldn't show up to a job interview with an unordered stack of printouts of our work for a
            potential employer to have to sift through. Instead, we would have it bound and put together in a
            professional-looking booklet.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-8 sm:mb-12 bg-secondary p-4 sm:p-6 rounded-md">
            A personal portfolio also gives you credibility. Anyone, like a potential employer or prospective client,
            may type your name into a search engine and find you in a short amount of time. Having zero presence on the
            internet doesn’t look good, no matter how accomplished you are.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl bg-secondary p-4 sm:p-6 rounded-md  mb-8 sm:mb-12">
            No matter if you’re a web designer, graphic designer, front-end developer, or some other occupation, you are
            more than a bulleted list of achievements. A portfolio site provides depth and detail. In your own words, it
            tells the story of projects you’re proud of and offers a glimpse into the thinking and personality of the
            person behind them.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl bg-secondary p-4 sm:p-6 rounded-md">
            An online portfolio provides a direct and centralized space to find you. You don’t have to send out gigantic
            email attachments. Clicking on a link is all it takes to land on examples of your work and to learn more
            about you.

          What you should include in a portfolio website
        </h3>

            When building your own portfolio, don’t feel like you need to include anything and everything you’ve ever
            created. Curate your best work and showcase the types of projects you’d like to do more of. As you create
            your portfolio, be sure to:
          </p>
          <div className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl bg-secondary p-4 sm:p-6 rounded-md">
            <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 sm:space-y-4 px-4">
              <li>Have a strategy behind the projects you feature in your website design.</li>
              <li>Know what skills you want to communicate.</li>
              <li>Recognize the type of clients you’d like to reach.</li>
              <li>Demonstrate your personal style and aesthetic.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl bg-secondary p-4 sm:p-6 rounded-md">
            Put together an online portfolio that captures the essence of your identity as a creative professional,
            tailored to the audience of potential employers and clients you want to reach. Think of your homepage as a
            cohesive body of work. Each project image, every block of writing, and all of the other elements come
            together in harmony to represent what you do.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl bg-secondary p-4 sm:p-6 rounded-md">
            Every project you've ever worked on was its own unique journey. From the initial spark of an idea to the
            final sign-off, there were individual challenges, problems that needed to be solved, and feedback that you
            had to respond to. Include big and brilliant examples of your work and go further than just providing a few
            tidy lines of text about each project. Tell their stories. Write case studies. Include examples of
            prototyping or mockups you created. Describe the steps that they took and how your role ultimately helped
            your clients to reach their goals.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl bg-secondary p-4 sm:p-6 rounded-md">
            Most creative projects involve collaboration. People want to know what it’s going to be like working with
            you and how your skills and talents can help them. By telling these stories, they get a glimpse into your
            creative process and know what to expect if they hire you.
